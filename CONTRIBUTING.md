# How to contribute
You may have to do some tinkering depending on your OS. Also this is mostly for running and developing for the front end. 

**0. Prerequisites**
<br>Before anything, make sure you have an Android Emulator up and running with a new-ish device set up to test your changes! Alternatively, you can use Expo Go on your mobile device and test there on a live machine. 
1. Clone the repo

> ```git clone https://github.com/enriquevlillo-a11y/tourist-luggage-app.git```<br>
> ```cd tourist-luggage-app```

2. Install dependencies
> ```npm install```

3. Start the Expo dev server
> ```npx expo start``` 

4. Create a new branch<br>
IMPORTANT: Make sure to checkout to a new branch before making any **major** changes. 
>```git checkout -b your-feature-name```

5. Commit your changes!<br> Commit frequently so you don't lose your work!
>```git add .```<br>
>```git commit -m "What I changed in this commit"```
6. Push your branch<br>
You're gonna wanna open a Pull Request afterwards so that it can be merged to main
>```git push origin your-feature-name```
