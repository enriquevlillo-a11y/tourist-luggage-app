# 🧳 Tourist Luggage App  

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Tourist Luggage App** is a mobile solution designed to solve a common problem for travelers: what to do with their bags after checking out of a hotel but before leaving the city.  

With this app, users can easily find secure, verified storage locations around the city where they can leave their luggage for a few hours or the entire day. This allows tourists to enjoy their remaining time without the burden of carrying bags.
